# Getting the ball rolling

## My first massive following spree

In my first year of GitHub usage, one night, I decided to do a bunch of follows. I went to the core Python repository, and followed over 1000 stargazers. This resulted in a lot of people visiting my profile, and I quickly made 100 followers. My account was temporarily suspended until I could confirm the email address.

I do not intend to do this again. Not because of the email verification, but because:

1. It is excessive and no longer needed (the ball is now rolling)
2. When I originally did this, I did not gather following data for the 1000+ users
