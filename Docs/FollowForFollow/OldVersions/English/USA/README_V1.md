# Follow for follow

## Seanpm2001

Via my main account, I engage in F4F. This means if you follow me and I haven't already followed you, I will follow you.

Sometimes I am busy. It can take up to 24 hours sometimes, and on extremely rare instances, 25 hours to 72 hours.

I follow regardless of the account type. This can sometimes include bots.

I hope to automate this in the future.

I do not do F4F on my alt account.
