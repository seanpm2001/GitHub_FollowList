# Hopes (1)

I am hoping that with the amount of followers I am getting, that at some point, interaction will become constant. Right now, it is a bit depressing, as I have 530+ followers, but hardly any actual interactions with them. I hope to build a team, and make these software pieces better, and I can't do it entirely by myself. Community has always been a goal.
