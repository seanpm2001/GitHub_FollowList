##### Blockchain honeypot

GitHub deleted the cryptobots that were following me, and I still have more than 400 followers. There are currently none following me in the latest page of my GitHub follows.

I was acting as a honeypot to capture as many of these bots as possible. All those links are likely dead now.

A bit unrelated, but on 2022, Thursday, May 12th, I made it back up to 435 followers, fully recovering from the cryptobot issue, now with legitimate, good followers taking the place of the disgusting NFT bots.

##### Follow for follow

None today.

##### Good bots

None today.
