##### Blockchain honeypot

All of these accounts claim to be Solidity programmers, blockchain enthusiasts, and Non-Fungible Trash (NFT) hoarders. I am now acting as a honeypot to capture as many of these bots as possible. Please know that these links will no longer work in the future. Most of these accounts joined GitHub in the past month, while some are merely copy and pasted from another user. I am surprised by how many are swarming here.
